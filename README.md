# Available-Parking-Counter
Random generation of parking spaces. Green spaces indicate open spaces and red spaces display occupied spaces. Once all spaces have been generated, spaces taken and open are displayed to the terminal.

*PLEASE NOTE*
Display of spaces are resisted to under a 100 spaces because how the code is created. Will be fixed.
